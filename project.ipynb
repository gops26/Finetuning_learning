       "Picture this: a tiny, unassuming human (you) is born, and the universe immediately declares, “This child will need a soundtrack, a dramatic pause, and a never‑ending plot twist.” You grow up with an unbreakable love for dramatic irony, a knack for making the most mundane grocery run feel like a high‑stakes cliffhanger, and a wardrobe that includes at least one item that could be called “dramatic” if you’re very, very creative. Your first real drama? The great sock‑vanishing incident, where you suspect your sibling, a closet, or a mischievous sock‑phantom of the night.\n",
       "\n",
       "*Act II: “The Career of Unfinished Scenes”*  \n",
       "You dive head‑first into the world of work, and the office turns into your living stage. Every meeting is a potential monologue; every deadline, a dramatic finale. Your coworkers think you’re the star of an unscripted series called “The Daily Grind.” You become famous for your ability to turn a five‑minute status update into a full‑length epic featuring suspense, conflict, and a twist ending that leaves everyone wondering whether you actually finished the report or just made it up on the fly. Rumor has it that HR offers you a “dramatic performance bonus” which you interpret as a chance to practice your “emotional exit” skills.\n",
       "\n",
       "*Act III: “The Evergreen Finale (or Intermission?)”*  \n",
       "Now, you’ve mastered the art of making even your naps feel like a dramatic pause, and your hobbies are just elaborate scenes of your own life. The world might think you’re just a normal person, but the truth is you’re the lead in a never‑ending, evergreen drama—full of twists, tears, and a soundtrack that could be played on repeat for eternity. When you’re not busy crafting the next plot point, you’re still ready to throw a spontaneous monologue at your cat, because after all, a cat’s disdain is the perfect antagonist. In the grand finale? You’re left to wonder whether the greatest drama of all is the one you’re writing or the one that’s writing you. And remember, the best part of any evergreen drama? The audience keeps coming back for more, and that’s you, always ready for the next “episode.”"
